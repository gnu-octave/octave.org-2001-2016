  <p>
    We always need more help improving Octave and there are many ways
    you can contribute.  You can help by fixing bugs, developing new
    features, answering questions on the mailing list or IRC channel,
    helping to improve the web pages.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are wondering what to work on, we have a standard answer:
    what would you like to work on?  We try not to tell contributors
    what to work on as most people do their best work when they are
    within their own field of interest.  So, we would love your help,
    but would also love for you to work on what you love.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you need some inspiration, we do maintain
    a <a href="http://www.octave.org/wiki/index.php?title=Projects">list of
    possible projects</a> on the Wiki.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have an idea on what to contribute, then join the
    maintainers mailing list and discuss your ideas there.  That way
    others can provide input early on, which makes your contribution
    more likely to get accepted.
  </p>

  <h1>Contacting developers</h1>
  <p>
    If you want to participate in Octave development, you should join
    the <a href="https://mailman.cae.wisc.edu/listinfo/octave-maintainers">
      <tt>maintainers@octave.org</tt></a> mailing list.
  </p>

  <p>
    For sometimes faster communication, you can also chat in IRC
    in <tt>#octave</tt> in Freenode. Note, however, that the primary
    medium for development talk is the mailing list.
  </p>

  <h1>Using the Development Sources</h1>
  <p>
    The latest development sources of Octave are also available via
    anonymous access to a read-only
    <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki">Mercurial</a>
    archive.
  </p>

  <p>
    The primary archive address
    is <a href="http://www.octave.org/hg/octave">http://www.octave.org/hg/octave</a>, 
    which currently redirects
    to <a href="http://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave">http://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you decide to use the development sources from the Mercurial
    archive, please read the
    file <a href="http://www.octave.org/hg/octave/file/tip/etc/HACKING"><tt>etc/HACKING</tt></a>
    that is available with the source files.
  </p> 

  <p>
    Assuming you have Mercurial installed on your machine you may
    check out the latest development version of Octave sources with
    the following command:
  </p>

  <div id="code">
    <code>hg clone http://www.octave.org/hg/octave</code>
  </div>

  <p>
    Once you have the repository checked out, you can resync with the
    archive by doing
  </p> 

  <div id="code">
    <code>hg -v pull</code><br>
    <code>hg -v update</code><br>
  </div>

  <p>
    The <tt>-v</tt> option is not required but provides extra
    information about what was pulled and updated.  The Octave manual
    has more information
    about <a href="doc/interpreter/Contributing-Guidelines.html#Contributing-Guidelines">contributing
    to Octave's development</a>.
  </p>
