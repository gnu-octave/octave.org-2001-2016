This window will be used to inform you about Octave community events.
Octave may show it to you even if you've chosen hide the window by
default.  We'll try not to bother you too much, but we do want to keep
you up to date with the latest information about important bug fixes,
new releases, or any other news that all Octave users should be aware of.
