<h4>Octaviz</h4>

<p>__HTTP__(`octaviz.sourceforge.net', `octaviz.sourceforge.net')
Current version 0.4.0</p>

<p>Octaviz is a visualization system for Octave. It is a wrapper that
makes all VTK classes accessible from within Octave using the same
object-oriented syntax as in C++ or Python. Octaviz also provides
high-level functions for 2D and 3D visualization. Using those
functions, most common visualization tasks (3D surface plots, contour
plots, meshes etc) can be accomplished without any knowledge about
VTK.</p>
