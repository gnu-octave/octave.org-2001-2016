<h4>Octaviz</h4>

<p>__HTTP__(`octaviz.sourceforge.net', `octaviz.sourceforge.net')
Current version 0.4.0</p>

<p>Octaviz is a visualization system for Octave. It is a wrapper that
makes all VTK classes accessible from within Octave using the same
object-oriented syntax as in C++ or Python. Octaviz also provides
high-level functions for 2D and 3D visualization. Using those
functions, most common visualization tasks (3D surface plots, contour
plots, meshes etc) can be accomplished without any knowledge about
VTK.</p>

<h4>Octplot</h4>

<p>__HTTP__(`octplot.sourceforge.net', `octplot.sourceforge.net')
Current version 0.3.5</p>

<p>OctPlot is a handle graphics package for Octave. OctPlot provides
quality postscript(TM) and screen graphics. OctPlot is free open
source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL).</p>

<p>OctPlot should run on following systems: Cygwin (MS Windows), Linux
(and possibly other UNIXs), OS X</p>
