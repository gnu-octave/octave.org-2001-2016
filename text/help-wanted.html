<h3>Ask not what Octave can do for you, ask what you can do
for Octave!</h3>

<p>
There are a number of ways that you can contribute to help make Octave a
better system.  Perhaps the most important way to contribute is to write
high-quality code for solving new problems, and to make your code freely
available for others to use.  For inspiration, we have a wish-list of
<a href="projects.html">projects</a>
and feature requests.
</p>

<p>
If you've written a useful function for Octave that you would like to
make available for others to use, please post it to the
<a href="mailto:sources@octave.org">sources</a>
mailing list.  Messages sent to this list will be seen by the Octave
maintainers, and will be considered for inclusion in future releases
of Octave.  The messages are also
<a href="text/archive.html">archived</a>, so even if the code
is not included in a future release, it will remain available for
others to use.
</p>

<p>
If you find Octave useful, consider 
<a href="text/funding.html">providing additional funding</a> to
continue its development.  Even a modest amount of additional funding
could make a significant difference in the amount of time that its
author can devote to development and support.
</p>

<p>
If you cannot provide funding or contribute code, you can still help
make Octave better and more reliable by
<a href="text/bugs.html">reporting any bugs</a> you find and by
offering suggestions for ways to improve Octave.
