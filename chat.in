__HEADER__(`Octave Chat')

<div class="section">

<p>The Freenode <abbrev title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbrev>
service has granted the Octave project the use of the <tt>#octave</tt>
channel for the purpose of chatting. Octave discussion for both
developers and users takes place here. The atmosphere is relaxed and
chat isn't restricted to matters strictly pertaining to Octave.
</p>

<p>
To use IRC you require an IRC client.
__HTTP__(`en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients',
`Many options exist'), and popular choices include
__HTTP__(`xchat.org', `Xchat'),
__HTTP__(`irssi.org', `irssi'),
__HTTPS__(`addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/16', `Chatzilla')
and __HTTP__(`colloquy.info', `Colloquy').
Most general-purpose chat clients like
__HTTP__(`pidgin.im', `Pidgin') and
__HTTP__(`kopete.kde.org', `Kopete')
can also be configured for IRC. Usually all you need to do is choose a
nickname or change the default, connect to <tt>irc.freenode.net</tt>
and join the <tt>#octave</tt> channel.
</p>

<p>
Freenode provides
__HTTP__(`webchat.freenode.net/?channels=octave&uio=MT1mYWxzZSYyPXRydWUmMTI9dHJ1ZQda',
`a web client') if you prefer to not use a program external to your
web browser. Just pick a nickname, fill out the captcha, and you'll be
directed to the <tt>#octave</tt> channel. For more information about
Freenode itself, including how to register a permanent identity within
the Freenode servers using services like Nickserv, consult
__HTTP__(`freenode.net/faq.shtmlcontents-userregistration',
`the documentation for Freenode').
