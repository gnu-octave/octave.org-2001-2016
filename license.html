    The source code for Octave is freely redistributable under the
    terms of the GNU General Public License
    (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>) as published by
    the <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Simply put, the GPL says that anyone who redistributes the
    software, with or without changes, must pass along the freedom to
    further copy and change it.  By distributing the complete source
    code for GNU Octave under the terms of the GPL, we guarantee that
    you and all other users will have the freedom to redistribute and
    change Octave.
  </p>

  <p>
    Releasing the source code for Octave has another benefit as well.
    By having access to all of the source code for a mathematical
    system like Octave, you have the ability to see <em>exactly</em>
    how each and every computation is performed.  There are no black
    boxes that hide the details of any calculation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although enhancements to Octave that are written as function files
    in Octave's scripting language are not required to be
    redistributed under the terms of the GPL, we encourage you to
    release your enhancements to Octave under the same terms for the
    benefit of all users.  We also encourage you
    to <a href="get-involved.html">get involved with the Octave
    project</a> and submit your changes for inclusion in future
    versions of Octave.
