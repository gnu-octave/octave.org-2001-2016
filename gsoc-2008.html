The following is a list of Octave project suggestions for
<a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008">Google Summer of Code 2008</a>.
The list only contains suggestions, and students are encouraged to present ideas
of their own (see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/projects.html">this page</a>
for inspiration). If you want further information about the suggested projects,
present a project suggestion of your own, or simply want to say hello, feel free
to write to the <a href="mailto:maintainers@octave.org">maintainers list</a>.

<dl>
<dt>Enhance the set of core functions missing in Octave</dt>
<dd>To improve compatibility with Matlab a set of core functions needs to be
implemented. A list of missing functions can be found in
<a href="http://www.cae.wisc.edu/pipermail/octave-maintainers/2008-March/006429.html">this thread</a>
on the maintainers@octave.org mailing list. The job would consist of selecting
a non-trivial subset of these functions and implement them.<br>

<i>Requires: m-file/octave programming, (possibly) a mathematical background</i>
</dd>

<dt>Implement support for transparency in OpenGL renderer</dt>
<dd>Currently an OpenGL based plotting system is being developed. This system
could use support for transparency. Handling this correctly is tricky, because
it requires the transparent primitives to be rendered from back to front, after
the opaque objects have been rendered. This includes:
<ul>
  <li>decomposing objects (patch, surface...) into primitives and storing them</li>
  <li>sorting (this should fast)</li>
  <li>rendering in order</li>
</ul>
A fast/smart mechanism is
needed. <a href="http://octave.sourceforge.net/jhandles/index.html">JHandles</a>
provides such basic mechanism, but it's far from efficient.<br>

<i>Requires: C++ programming, OpenGL knowledge, Computer Science background (you
might have to deal with BST, sort algorithm...)</i>
</dd>

<dt>Implement an OpenGL-based backend in one existing IDE for Octave</dt>
<dd>
Work is going on the add an OpenGL renderer built into Octave; this
renderer can then be used by 3rd-party graphics backends, with
reduced effort (octave will provides a built-in FLTK-based backend).
There exists 2 active IDE's for Octave:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/octavede">OctaveDE (GTK)</a>
and <a href="http://qtoctave.wordpress.com/">QtOctave</a>.
The job would consist of writing a backend integrated in one of
those existing IDE's, based on the Octave built-in OpenGL renderer.
Given the fact that OctaveDE has already a terminal emulation
and can run octave in-process, this is probably the most suitable IDE.<br>

<i>Requires: C++ programming, GTK (Qt?) knowledge, (small) OpenGL
knowledge</i>
</dd>

<dt>Implement text rendering in OpenGL renderer</dt>
<dd>
Text rendering would be
based on FreeType for glyph production and send to OpenGL, either
through pixmaps or textures. Moreover, text processing would be needed
to implement TeX-like interpreter for text objects. The job would includes:
defining data structures to hold interpreted text elements, defining
processors/visitors to perform operation on interpreted text (for instance
to compute text bounding box, subscript offsets...), rendering text element
with FreeType/OpenGL<br>

<i>Requires: C++ programming, small FreeType/OpenGL knowledge (no deep
knowledge is required)</i>
</dd>

<dt>Implement a 2D-only Cairo-based renderer</dt>
<dd>
Work is going on to add an
OpenGL-based renderer built into Octave. However, while OpenGL is good
for 3D rendering, it has some limitations for plain 2D rendering. A cairo-based
renderer would provide much better results. The target would be to only
take into account 2D rendering, such that polygon sorting or line removal
would not be considered, simplifying the rendering code. As a side-job,
porting the built-in FLTK backend to use cairo rendering could also be
considered.<br>

<i>Requires: C++ programming, Cairo (FLTK) knowledge.</i>
</dd>

<dt>Improve Tools for Optimisation</dt>
<dd>
Octave is currently lacking good general purpose algorithms for
optimisation. A standard problem is the Non-linear Least Squares
minimisation. The goal of the project should be to implement the
standard algorithms, such as Gauss-Newton, and Levenberg-Marquardt.
Alternatively, it would be nice if the functions for Quadratic Programming,
and Sequential Quadratic Programming could be improved.<br>

<i>Requires: basic knowledge about optimisation, Octave programming</i>
</dd>

<dt>Upgrade specialized plots</dt>
<dd>
The Octave plotting system is currently being updated to match the Matlab
system more closely. Soon hggroup objects and listeners will be available.
The goal of the project would be to implement specialized plots in the
Matlab-way (errorseries, contourseries...).<br>

<i>Requires: Octave/m-file programming</i>
</dd>
