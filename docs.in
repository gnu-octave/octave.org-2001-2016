__HEADER__(`Octave Documentation')

<div class="section">

<p>Octave is fully documented by a comprehensive
__OCTAVE_HTTP__(`doc/interpreter', `375 page manual') (a
__HTTP__(`www.octave.cz', `&#268;esk&#253; (Czech) Version'
) and a
__HTTP__(`www.obihiro.ac.jp/~suzukim/masuda/octave/html/',
`日本語 (Japanese) Version') are available).  The version
available here has been converted to HTML directly from the Texinfo
source files that are distributed along with every copy of the Octave
source code.  You can also use those same source files to create a
printed copy of the manual, or a copy suitable for viewing with GNU
Info readers (within GNU Emacs, using the standalone Info reader,
etc.). The complete text of the manual is also available at the Octave
prompt using the command <samp>`help -i'</samp> (this command invokes
the GNU Info browser for you).</p>

<p>A printed version of the Octave manual is also now available and may
be ordered from __HTTP__(`www.network-theory.co.uk/octave/manual/').
Any money raised from the sale of this book will support the
development of free software.  For each copy sold $1 will be
donated to the GNU Octave Development Fund.</p>

<p>If your questions are not answered by the manual, or by this web site,
there is also the __OCTAVE_HTTP__(`FAQ.html', `FAQ'), a list of
frequently asked questions with answers.  The copy of the FAQ
available here is generally more current than the version distributed
with Octave releases.</p>

<p>Finally, if even the FAQ doesn't provide the answer you are looking
for, the __OCTAVE_HTTP__(`help.html', `help-octave') mailing list
exists for the discussion of matters related to using and installing
Octave.</p>
