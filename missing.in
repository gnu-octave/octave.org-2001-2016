  <h1>So, you tried to use a missing function...?</h1>

  <p>
    GNU Octave strives to be among the very best numerical tools
    available.  While compatibility with Matlab is one of many strong
    features of Octave, we have not achieved 100% compatibility.  If
    you are reading this page, it is most likely because you attempted
    to use a function that is part of core Matlab, but has yet to be
    implemented in Octave.
  </p>

  <p>
    There can be several reasons for the given function not to exist
    in Octave:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The function may exist
      in <a href="http://octave.sourceforge.net">Octave-Forge</a>, but
      has not yet been adopted as a part of the core Octave
      distribution.  You can try to look for your function in
      the <a href="http://octave.sourceforge.net/functions_by_alpha.php">alphabetical
      list of functions</a> at the Octave-Forge web site to see if it
      is available in some package.
    </li>
    <li>
      The function may be new to Matlab.  It is possible that the Octave
      community simply does not know it exists. Should this be the case,
      feel free to open a feature request in the
      <a href="http://bugs.octave.org">Octave bug tracker</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The Octave community consists of volunteers working in their spare
    time.  As a result, development might sometimes not be fast enough for
    your needs.  If you have a feature request for Octave, the best way to
    ensure that your suggested improvement gets incorporated is either to
    implement the feature yourself or to pay somebody to do it for you.
