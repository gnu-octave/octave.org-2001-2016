<h3 class="section">38.1 Installing and Removing Packages</h3>

<p>Assuming a package is available in the file <code>image-1.0.0.tar.gz</code>
it can be installed from the Octave prompt by writing

<pre class="example">     pkg install image-1.0.0.tar.gz
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the package is installed successfully nothing will be printed on
the prompt, but if an error occurred during installation it will be
reported. It is possible to install several packages at once by
writing several package files after the <code>pkg install</code> command. 
If a different version of the package is already installed it will
be removed prior to installing the new package. This makes it easy to
upgrade and downgrade the version of a package, but makes it
impossible to have several versions of the same package installed at
once.

   <p>To see which packages are installed type

<pre class="example">     pkg list
          -| Package Name  | Version | Installation directory
          -| --------------+---------+-----------------------
          -|        image *|   1.0.0 | /home/jwe/octave/image-1.0.0
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this case only version 1.0.0 of the <code>image</code> package is
installed. The '*' character next to the package name shows that the
image package is loaded and ready for use.

   <p>It is possible to remove a package from the system using the
<code>pkg uninstall</code> command like this

<pre class="example">     pkg uninstall image
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the package is removed successfully nothing will be printed in the
prompt, but if an error occurred it will be reported. It should be
noted that the package file used for installation is not needed for
removal, and that only the package name as reported by <code>pkg list</code>
should be used when removing a package. It is possible to remove
several packages at once by writing several package names after the
<code>pkg uninstall</code> command.

   <p>To minimize the amount of code duplication between packages it is
possible that one package depends on another one. If a package
depends on another, it will check if that package is installed
during installation. If it is not, an error will be reported and
the package will not be installed. This behaviour can be disabled
by passing the <code>-nodeps</code> flag to the <code>pkg install</code>
command

<pre class="example">     pkg install -nodeps my_package_with_dependencies.tar.gz
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Since the installed package expects its dependencies to be installed
it may not function correctly. Because of this it is not recommended
to disable dependency checking.
