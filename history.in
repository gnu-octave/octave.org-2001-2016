<p>
Octave was originally conceived (in about 1988) to be companion
software for an undergraduate-level textbook on chemical reactor
design being written by James B. Rawlings of the University of
Wisconsin-Madison and John G. Ekerdt of the University of Texas.
We originally envisioned some very specialized tools for the solution
of chemical reactor design problems.  Later, after seeing the
limitations of that approach, we opted to attempt to build a much more
flexible tool.

<p>
There were still some people who said that we should just be using
Fortran instead, because it is the computer language of engineering,
but every time we had tried that, the students spent far too much time
trying to figure out why their Fortran code failed and not enough time
learning about chemical engineering.  We believed that with an
interactive environment like Octave, most students would be able to
pick up the basics quickly, and begin using it confidently in just a
few hours.
</p>

<p>
Full-time development began in the Spring of 1992.  The first alpha
release was January 4, 1993, and version 1.0 was released February 17,
1994.  Since then, Octave has been through several major revisions, is
included with __HTTP__(`www.debian.org', `Debian GNU/Linux') and
__HTTP__(`www.suse.com', `SuSE') __HTTP__(`www.linux.org', `Linux')
distributions, and was reviewed in the in the July, 1997 issue of the
__HTTP__(`www.linuxjournal.com/lj-issues/issue39/1225.html',
	 `Linux Journal').
</p>

<p>
Clearly, Octave is now much more than just another `courseware'
package with limited utility beyond the classroom.  Although our
initial goals were somewhat vague, we knew that we wanted to create
something that would enable students to solve realistic problems, and
that they could use for many things other than chemical reactor design
problems.  Today, thousands of people worldwide are using Octave in
teaching, research, and commercial applications.
</p>

<p>
Just about everyone thinks that the name Octave has something to do
with music, but it is actually the name of one of the author's former
professors who wrote a famous textbook on chemical reaction
engineering, and who was also well known for his ability to do quick
"back of the envelope" calculations.  We hope that this software will
make it possible for many people to do more ambitious computations
just as easily.
