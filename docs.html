<h2>Octave Documentation</h2>

<p>Octave is fully documented by a comprehensive
<a href="http://velveeta.che.wisc.edu/octave/doc">375 page manual</a>.  The
version available here has been converted to HTML directly from the
Texinfo source files that are distributed along with every copy of the
Octave source code.  You can also use those same source files to
create a printed copy of the manual, or a copy suitable for viewing
with GNU Info readers (within GNU Emacs, using the standalone Info
reader, etc.). The complete text of the manual is also available at
the Octave prompt using the command <samp>help -i</samp> (this
command invokes the GNU Info browser for you).</p>

<p>A printed version of the Octave manual is also now available and may
be ordered from <a href="http://www.network-theory.co.uk/octave/manual/">http://www.network-theory.co.uk/octave/manual/</a>.
Any money raised from the sale of this book will support the
development of free software.  For each copy sold $1 will be
donated to the GNU Octave Development Fund.</p>

<p>If your questions are not answered by the manual, or by this web site,
there is also the <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a>, a list of
frequently asked questions with answers.  The copy of the FAQ
available here is generally more current than the version distributed
with Octave releases.</p>

<p>Finally, if even the FAQ doesn't provide the answer you are looking
for, the <a href="help.html">help-octave</a> mailing list
exists for the discussion of matters related to using and installing
Octave.</p>
