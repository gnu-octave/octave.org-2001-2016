for Octave!')

<p>There are a number of ways that you can contribute to help make
Octave a better system.  Perhaps the most important way to contribute
is to write high-quality code for solving new problems, and to make
your code freely available for others to use.  For inspiration, we
have a wish-list of __OCTAVE_HTTP__(`projects.html', `projects') and feature
requests.</p>

<p>If you've written a useful function for Octave that you would like
to make available for others to use, please post it to the
__MAILTO__(`sources@octave.org', `sources') mailing list.  Messages
sent to this list will be seen by the Octave maintainers, and will be
considered for inclusion in future releases of Octave.  The messages
are also __OCTAVE_HTTP__(`archive.html', `archived'), so even if the
code is not included in a future release, it will remain available for
others to use.</p>

<p>If you find Octave useful, consider 
__OCTAVE_HTTP__(`funding.html', `providing additional funding') to
continue its development.  Even a modest amount of additional funding
could make a significant difference in the amount of time that its
author can devote to development and support.</p>

<p>If you cannot provide funding or contribute code, you can still
help make Octave better and more reliable by
__OCTAVE_HTTP__(`bugs.html', `reporting any bugs') you find and by
offering suggestions for ways to improve Octave.</p>
