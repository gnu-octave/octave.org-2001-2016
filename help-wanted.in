for Octave!')

<p>There are a number of ways that you can contribute to help make
Octave a better system.  Perhaps the most important way to contribute
is to write high-quality code for solving new problems, and to make
your code freely available for others to use.  For inspiration, we
have a wish-list of __OCTAVE_HTTP__(`projects.html', `projects') and feature
requests.</p>

<p>If you have modifications to the core Octave distribution (bug
fixes or enhancements), please post the changes to the
__MAILTO__(`bug@octave.org') mailing list.</p>

<p>If you've written a useful function for Octave that you would like
to make available for others to use, please consider contributing it
to the Octave Forge project __HTTP__(`octave.sf.net').</p>

<p>If you find Octave useful, consider 
__OCTAVE_HTTP__(`funding.html', `providing additional funding') to
continue its development.  Even a modest amount of additional funding
could make a significant difference in the amount of time that its
author can devote to development and support.</p>

<p>If you cannot provide funding or contribute code, you can still
help make Octave better and more reliable by reporting any bugs you
find and by offering suggestions for ways to improve Octave.  But
before sending a bug report, please read __OCTAVE_HTTP__(`bugs.html',
`the bug reporting guidelines') so that you'll know what information
is useful to include in your report.</p>
