<h2>Funding for Future Development</h2>

<p>The easiest and most secure way to make a contribution to the
Octave project is to use the UW Foundation's <a
href="https://secure.uwfoundation.wisc.edu/MultiPage/processStep1.do">secure
online form</a>.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b>To make sure that your contribution is directed to
the Octave project and not to the general UW Foundation fund, you must
do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Select "Other - detailed below" from the drop down menu in the
"Designation" section of the form.</li>
<li>Insert the following instructions into the text box:
<blockquote>
   <p>I/we wish to support development of the Octave modeling
   language, under the supervision of Professor James B. Rawlings of
   the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at
   UW-Madison.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>If your contribution does not include these instructions, it will
probably not find its way to our account for Octave.</p>

<p>If you wish to mail your contribution, complete this
<a href="giftform.html">form</a> and send it, along with a check (or
credit card information) payable to the University of Wisconsin
Foundation, to the address shown on the form.</p>

<p>Nearly all of Octave's development has been paid for using
unrestricted funding from various sources, or from grants for other
projects that have used Octave, but for which writing and improving
Octave was not the central focus.  Funding Octave this way has worked
out reasonably well so far, but now we are looking for new ways to
provide a more stable funding base for the future.</p>

<p>If you are aware of any funding opportunities within your
organization that could help ensure that Octave development continues,
please contact <a href="mailto:jwe@octave.org">John W. Eaton</a>.</p>

have helped with the development of Octave.</p>
