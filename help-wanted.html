<p>There are a number of ways that you can contribute to help make
Octave a better system.  Perhaps the most important way to contribute
is to write high-quality code for solving new problems, and to make
your code freely available for others to use.  For inspiration, we
have a wish-list of <a href="projects.html">projects</a> and feature
requests.</p>

<p>If you've written a useful function for Octave that you would like
to make available for others to use, please post it to the
<a href="mailto:sources@octave.org">sources</a> mailing list.  Messages
sent to this list will be seen by the Octave maintainers, and will be
considered for inclusion in future releases of Octave.  The messages
are also <a href="archive.html">archived</a>, so even if the
code is not included in a future release, it will remain available for
others to use.</p>

<p>If you find Octave useful, consider 
<a href="funding.html">providing additional funding</a> to
continue its development.  Even a modest amount of additional funding
could make a significant difference in the amount of time that its
author can devote to development and support.</p>

<p>If you cannot provide funding or contribute code, you can still
help make Octave better and more reliable by
<a href="bugs.html">reporting any bugs</a> you find and by
offering suggestions for ways to improve Octave.</p>
