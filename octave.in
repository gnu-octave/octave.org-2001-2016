GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing
other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible
with Matlab. It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.</p>

<dd>Path manipulation was significantly cleaned up.  Now instead of
manipulating the <code>LOADPATH</code> variable, you can use the
<code>addpath</code>, <code>rmpath</code>, and <code>path</code>
functions.

<dd>All warn_* built-in variables were removed and replaced by warning
identifiers that may be used with the warning function.  For example,
<code>warn_divide_by_zero = false;</code> would now be
<code>warning ("off", "Octave:divide-by-zero");</code>.
