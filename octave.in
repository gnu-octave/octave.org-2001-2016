GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing
other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible
with Matlab. It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.</p>

if you are having trouble compiling Octave 2.9.6 with GCC 3.x.  After
applying the patch, you'll need to run autogen.sh and configure
again.  This means you'll need to have a recent version of autoconf
installed.  Or, you can upgrade to GCC 4.x or you can wait for
2.9.7.  So many options!</dd>
<dt>June 9, 2006</dt>
<dd>Version 2.9.6 is now available for ftp.

<dd>Function file cacheing has been improved with hopefully major 
speedups when calling m-file functions.

the main Octave distribution.

<dd>Path manipulation was significantly cleaned up.  Now instead of
manipulating the <code>LOADPATH</code> variable, you can use the
<code>addpath</code>, <code>rmpath</code>, and <code>path</code>
functions.
