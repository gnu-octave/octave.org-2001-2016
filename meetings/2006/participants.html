<a name="Annamalai"><h2>Octave-GTK: A GTK binding for GNU Octave</h2></a>
<p>Muthiah Annamalai</p>
<p>Language binding, is a favorite solution for programming language
interoperability problems, that helps extend the reuse of libraries, and
save developer's time, all the same providing new functionality to the
host language.  In this paper, we discuss the problems faced with
interoperability between two programming langauges, with respect to GNU
Octave, and GTK API written in C, to provide the GTK API on Octave as a
part of Octave-GTK, our research project.  Octave-GTK is the fusion of two
different API's exported by GNU Octave [scientific computing tool] and
GTK [GUI toolkit], to use GTK primitives within GNU Octave, to build graphical
front ends, at the same time using Octave engine for number crunching power.
Octave GTK, is a GTK binding for Octave.  The concept of binding is
prevalent in the world of free software, and this paper illustrates our
implementation this technologies, and binding logic.  Also shown, are
methods of code generation, binding automation, and the niche we plan to
fill in the absence of GUI in Octave.  Canonical discussion of advantages,
feasibility and problems faced in the process are elucidated.</p>

<a name="Eddelbuettel"><h2>Octave and Quantian: Integrating a high-level numerical language into a scientific computing environment</h2></a>
<p>Dirk Eddelbuettel</p>
<p>Octave (Eaton, 2001) is a high-level language and a programming environment 
with a primary focus on numerical computations---in particular linear algebra, 
nonlinear and differential equations--that is also highly suitable for 
statistical analysis, visualization, prototyping, scripting, batch processing 
and more. Octave implements a language not unlike that of another leading 
(commercial) brand. The language is highly intuitive: expression 'just like 
the math on the paper' make Octave an excellent choice for use in teaching 
and research. Another strength of Octave is the extensibility using compiled 
C/C++ or Fortran code.</p> 

<p>Quantian (Eddelbuettel, 2003) is a comprehensive scientific computing 
environment that is distributed as a single bootable DVD. With automatic 
configuration of all major hardware aspects (graphics, networking, sound, 
USB interfaces, ...), Quantian can turn any idle desktop or laptop into a 
scientific workstation within minutes. Quantian contains approximately seven 
gigabytes of installed and configured software that is ready for immediate 
use. Quantian has a clear focus on scientific, numerical and quantitative 
applications.</p>

<p>Moreover, Quantian provides openMosix to create single-system image 
clusters of workstations as well as standard parallel computing toolkits 
like PVM and LAM/MPICH. Any machine running Quantian can act as a master 
node from which other nodes can be booted remotely: an entire lab can be 
turned into a computing cluster within minutes.</p>

<p>Quantian has always contained Octave as well as an increasing number 
of additional packages for Octave: octave-epstk, octave-forge, octave-gpc,
octave-plplot, octaviz. We argue that the complete control over the 
installation within the framework of a Quantian image permits for unparallel 
customization. This allows to highlight ever possible aspect of a computing 
system. For example, Quantian contains just about every visualization and 
plotting front-end that can be tied to Octave. This tight coupling and 
predictable configuration makes Quantian an ideal platfom for Octave 
research, demos and distribution.</p>

<p>Quantian draws from from Knoppix and Debian. Time permitting, we may 
also discuss aspects of Octave package maintenance in Debian, its possible 
feedback on Octave development and its role to Quantian development.</p>
