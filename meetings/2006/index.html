Octave 2006<br>
Washington, DC - April 20-21, 2006
</center></font></b>

<p>The first Octave Workshop will be held April 20-12, 2006 at the
<a href="http://www.nist.gov">National Institute of Standards and 
Technology</a> in Gaithersburg, MD USA.</p>

<p>This will be a gathering of Octave developers and users to provide
a forum for discussing the current state and the future of Octave and
its application areas.  Topics include language improvements, numerical 
methods, application areas, proposed extensions and infrastructure 
developments.</p>

<p>Gaithersburg's location near Washington DC, Annapolis and Baltimore 
provides easy access to tourism and entertainment opportunities for 
conference attendees and their accompanying persons.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="cfp.html">Call for Papers</a> for submission
guidelines and important dates.</p>

<p>We have no specific hotel arrangements.  The NIST web site has generic
<a href="http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/visitor/visitor.htm">visitor 
information</a> for NIST and Gaithersburg.</p>

<p>A tentative <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a> of talks is available.  See
the <a href="participants.html">list of participants</a> for abstracts and
