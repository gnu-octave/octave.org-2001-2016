<h2>3.8.0 Released</h2>
<p>
Octave 3.8.0 is now available
at <a href="ftp.gnu.org/gnu/octave/octave-3.8.0.tar.gz">ftp.gnu.org/gnu/octave/octave-3.8.0.tar.gz</a>.
</p>
<p>
Octave 3.8 is a major new release with many new features, including an
experimental graphical user interface.  But because the GUI is not
quite as polished as we would like, we have decided to wait until the
4.0.x release series before making the GUI the default interface.
Until then, you can use the <tt>--force-gui</tt> option to start the GUI.
See the release notes or the "Experimental GUI Info" button in the GUI
for more information about the release and how you can help us with
GUI development and speed up the 4.0 release.

<h2>Community News Window in Octave 3.8</h2>
<p>
Beginning with the 3.8.x release series of Octave, we will be
displaying news about Octave community events here.  In Octave's GUI
interface, this window will appear when there is new information.
Octave will check for it at most once per day.
