if you are having trouble compiling Octave 2.9.6 with GCC 3.x.  
After applying the patch, you'll need to run autogen.sh and configure
again.  This means you'll need to have a recent version of 
autoconf installed.  Or, you can upgrade to GCC 4.x or you can wait for
2.9.7.  So many options!</dd>

<code>addpath</code>, <code>rmpath</code>, and <code>path</code>
functions.

<dt>May 2, 2006</dt>
<dd>All warn_* built-in variables were removed and replaced by warning
identifiers that may be used with the warning function.  For example,
