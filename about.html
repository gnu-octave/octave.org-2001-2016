  <p>
    GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended
    for numerical computations.  It provides a convenient
    command line interface for solving linear and nonlinear
    problems numerically, and for performing other numerical
    experiments using a language that is mostly compatible
    with Matlab.  It may also be used as a batch-oriented
    language.
  </p>

  <p>
    Octave has extensive tools for solving common numerical
    linear algebra problems, finding the roots of nonlinear
    equations, integrating ordinary functions, manipulating
    polynomials, and integrating ordinary differential and
    differential-algebraic equations.  It is easily
    extensible and customizable via user-defined functions
    written in Octave's own language, or using dynamically
    loaded modules written in C++, C, Fortran, or other
    languages.
  </p>

  <p>
    GNU Octave is also freely redistributable software.  You
    may redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of

  <h1>History</h1>

  <p>
    Octave was originally conceived (in about 1988) to be companion
    software for an undergraduate-level textbook on chemical reactor
    design being written by James B. Rawlings of the University of
    Wisconsin-Madison and John G. Ekerdt of the University of Texas.
    We originally envisioned some very specialized tools for the solution
    of chemical reactor design problems.  Later, after seeing the
    limitations of that approach, we opted to attempt to build a much more
    flexible tool.
  </p>

  <p>
    There were still some people who said that we should just be using
    Fortran instead, because it is the computer language of engineering,
    but every time we had tried that, the students spent far too much time
    trying to figure out why their Fortran code failed and not enough time
    learning about chemical engineering.  We believed that with an
    interactive environment like Octave, most students would be able to
    pick up the basics quickly, and begin using it confidently in just a
    few hours.
  </p>

  <p>
    Full-time development began in the Spring of 1992.  The first alpha
    release was January 4, 1993, and version 1.0 was released February 17,
    1994.  Since then, Octave has been through several major revisions, is
    included with <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian GNU/Linux</a> and
    <a href="http://www.novell.com/linux/suse/">SuSE</a>
    <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a> distributions, and was reviewed in
    the in the July, 1997 issue of the
    <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1225">Linux Journal</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clearly, Octave is now much more than just another courseware
    package with limited utility beyond the classroom.  Although our
    initial goals were somewhat vague, we knew that we wanted to create
    something that would enable students to solve realistic problems, and
    that they could use for many things other than chemical reactor design
    problems.  Today, thousands of people worldwide are using Octave in
    teaching, research, and commercial applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just about everyone thinks that the name Octave has something to do
    with music, but it is actually the name of one of the author's former
    professors who wrote a famous textbook on chemical reaction
    engineering, and who was also well known for his ability to do quick
    "back of the envelope" calculations.  We hope that this software will
    make it possible for many people to do more ambitious computations
    just as easily.

    encouraged to help make Octave more useful by writing and contributing
    additional functions for it, and by reporting any problems you may
    have.
