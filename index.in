    GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended
    for numerical computations.  It provides capabilities for the numerical
    solution of linear and nonlinear problems, and for performing
    other numerical experiments.  It also provides extensive graphics
    capabilities for data visualization and manipulation.  Octave is
    normally used through its interactive command line interface, but
    it can also be used to write non-interactive programs.  The Octave
    language is quite similar to Matlab so that most programs are easily
    portable.

  <h2>March 7, 2014 &mdash; Octave 3.8.1 Released</h2>
  <p>
    Version 3.8.1 is a bug fixing release and is now available for
    <a href="download.html">download</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the biggest new features for the Octave 3.8.x release
    series is a graphical user interface.  It is the one thing that
    users have requested most often over the last few years and now it
    is almost ready.  But because it is not quite as polished as we
    would like, we have decided to wait until the 4.0.x release series
    before making the GUI the default interface (until then, you can use
    the <tt>--force-gui</tt> option to start the GUI).
  </p>
  <p>
    Given the length of time and the number of bug fixes and
    improvements since the last major release Octave, we also decided
    against delaying the release any longer.  So please enjoy the 3.8
    release of Octave and the preview of the new GUI.  We believe it
    is working reasonably well, but we also know that there are some
    obvious rough spots and many things that could be improved.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>We need your help</strong>.  There are many ways that you
    can help us fix the remaining problems, complete the GUI, and
    improve the overall user experience for both novices and experts
    alike:
