    GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended
    for numerical computations.  It provides capabilities for the numerical
    solution of linear and nonlinear problems, and for performing
    other numerical experiments.  It also provides extensive graphics
    capabilities for data visualization and manipulation.  Octave is
    normally used through its interactive command line interface, but
    it can also be used to write non-interactive programs.  The Octave
    language is quite similar to Matlab so that most programs are easily
    portable.
