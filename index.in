<p>GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended
for numerical computations.  It provides capabilities for the numerical
solution of linear and nonlinear problems, and for performing
other numerical experiments.  It also provides extensive graphics
capabilities for data visualization and manipulation.  Octave is
normally used through its interactive command line interface, but
it can also be used to write non-interactive programs.  The Octave
language is quite similar to Matlab so that most programs are easily
portable.</p>
