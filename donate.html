  <p>
    Octave development takes a lot of time and expertise.  Your
    contributions help to ensure that Octave will continue to
    improve.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are already an Octave user and would like to see it improve
    more rapidly, then please donate so that we can spend more of our
    time working on Octave.  If we could raise as little as
    $300,000/year, we could pay several key developers to work full
    time on Octave.  Given even the most conservative estimate of the
    number of users of Octave, this amount could easily be reached if
    every user contributed the cost of a few lattes.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your company has a budget for numerical computing tools,
    consider spending 10% (or more!) of that on Octave.  Do you expect
    Octave to improve on a $0 budget while the proprietary tools are
    well-funded by your license fees?
  </p>

  <p>
    Consider <a href="commercial-support.html">hiring someone</a> to
    implement the specific features you need.
