__TITLE_BAR__(`Funding for Future Development')

<p>
Octave used to receive support from a fund at the University of
Wisconsin Foundation. Nowadays, __HTTP__(`fsf.org', `Free Software
Foundation') is supporting Octave, and donations to its fund can be
made __HTTPS__(`my.fsf.org/donate/working-together/octave',
`using this secure online form.')</a>

<p>In the past, nearly all of Octave's development was paid for using
unrestricted funding from various sources, or from grants for other
projects that have used Octave, but for which writing and improving
Octave was not the central focus. Funding Octave this way worked out
reasonably well for its time, but now we are looking for new ways to
provide a more stable funding base for the future.</p>

<p>If you are aware of any funding opportunities within your
organization that could help ensure that Octave development continues,
please contact __MAILTO__(`jwe@octave.org', `John W. Eaton').</p>

<p>Please see the __OCTAVE_HTTP__(`acknowledgments.html',
`contributors') page for a list of people and organizations who
have helped with the development of Octave.</p>
