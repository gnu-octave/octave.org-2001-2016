if you are having trouble compiling Octave 2.9.6 with GCC 3.x.  
After applying the patch, you'll need to run autogen.sh and configure
again.  This means you'll need to have a recent version of 
autoconf installed.  Or, you can upgrade to GCC 4.x or you can wait for
2.9.7.  So many options!</dd>
<dt>June 9, 2006</dt>

<dd>All warn_* built-in variables were removed and replaced by warning
