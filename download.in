<div class="section">
__TITLE_BAR__(`Latest Release')

<p>There are several different versions of Octave available for
download:</p>

<dl>
<dt>stable</dt>
<dd>This version is well tested and is the recommended version for
most users of Octave.</dd>
<!--
<dt>testing</dt>
<dd>A recent snapshot of the development sources that has been selected as
being reasonably good.  Most people who are not actively involved in
Octave's development will want to use this version.</dd>
-->
<dt>development</dt>
<dd>The most recent snapshot of the development sources (if one is
available).  Use this if you want the latest features and it doesn't
bother you that you might run into a few problems.  These snapshots
are <b>not</b> regular Octave releases.  They are only provided for
testing purposes, for people who would rather not bother with getting
sources from the Mercurial archive.  If you do find
problems in the development snapshots, please report them to the
maintainers@octave.org mailing list (but first read
__OCTAVE_HTTP__(`bugs.html', `the bug reporting guidelines')).
If you are interested in the absolutely-latest-up-to-the-minute
changes, you may use the sources from the public Mercurial archive
instead (see below for details).
