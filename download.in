__TITLE_BAR__(`Latest Release')

<p>There are several different versions of Octave available for
download:</p>

<dl>
<dt>stable</dt>
<dd>This version is well tested, reliable, but also quite old and no
longer maintained.</dd>
<dt>testing</dt>
<dd>A recent snapshot of the development sources that has been selected as
being reasonably good.  Most people who are not actively involved in
Octave's development will want to use this version.</dd>
<dt>development</dt>
<dd>The most recent snapshot of the development sources.  Use this if you
want the latest features and it doesn't bother you that you might run
into a few problems (if you do, please report them).  If you are
interested in up-to-the-minute changes, you may use the sources from
the public CVS archive instead (see below for details).</dd>

__TITLE_BAR__(`Contributed Packages')

<p>A collection of contributed packages for Octave is available from
__HTTP__(`octave.sf.net').</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
__TITLE_BAR__(`Binaries')

<p>Please note that all binary distributions of Octave are built by
volunteers.  We make no promises about these binary packages.  If they
are out of date and you would like to help keep them current, please
contact the people who are responsible for the sites that distribute
the various packages.</p>

<h4>Linux</h4>

<p>Binaries for Linux distributions are generally available with
the distribution (__HTTP__(`www.debian.org', `Debian'),
__HTTP__(`www.novell.com/linux/suse', `SuSE'),
__HTTP__(`www.redhat.com', `RedHat'), and others have packages).</p>

<h4>Mac OS X</h4>

<ul>
<li>__HTTP__(`octave.sourceforge.net', `Octave Forge')</li>
<li>__HTTP__(`hpc.sourceforge.net',
             `Mac OS X High Performance Computing')</li>
<li>__HTTP__(`fink.sourceforge.net', `The Fink project')</li>
<li>__HTTP__(`www.macports.org', `MacPorts')</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sun Solaris</h4>

<p>The site __HTTP__(`www.sunfreeware.com') has a binary distribution
of Octave for Sun systems.</p>

<h4>Windows</h4>

<ul>
<li>The __HTTP__(`octave.sourceforge.net', `Octave Forge') project
hosts a native Windows binary distribution of Octave built with
MSVC.  It should also be possible to build a comparable package with
the MinGW compiler, but we need a volunteer for that job.</li>

<li>__HTTP__(`www.cygwin.com')
The Cygwin binary package is out of date.  If you'd like to help bring
it up to date, please start by reading the README.Cygwin file in the
Octave sources.</li>
</ul>

<h4>OS/2 or eComStation</h4>

<p>Dmitry Froloff has built OS/2 binaries that are available at
<a href="http://froloff.homeip.net/">http://froloff.homeip.net/</a>.</p>

<p>If you decide to use the development sources from the CVS
archive, please read the file __OCTAVE_FTP__(`/bleeding-edge/README',

<div class="code"><code>ssh</code></div>

<p>Set CVSROOT in your environment to</p>

<div class="code"><code>:ext:anoncvs@www.octave.org:/cvs</code></div>

<p>Or alternately add</p>

<div class="code"><code>-d :ext:anoncvs@www.octave.org:/cvs</code></div>

<p>in the CVS commands below (place it immediately after <code>cvs</code>,
before any other CVS arguments).</p>

<p>Issue the command</p>
