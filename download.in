  <h1>GNU/Linux systems</h1>
  <p>
    Executable versions of Octave for GNU/Linux systems are provided
    by the individual distributions.  Distributions known to package
    Octave include: <a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a>,
    <a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a>,
    <a href="http://gentoo.org">Gentoo</a>,
    and <a href="http://opensuse.org">SuSE</a>.  These packages are
    created by volunteers.  The delay between an Octave source release
    and the availability of a package for a particular GNU/Linux
    distribution varies.  The Octave project has no control over that
    process.
