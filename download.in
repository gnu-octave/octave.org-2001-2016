__TITLE_BAR__(`Latest Release')

<p>There are several different versions of Octave available for
download:</p>

<dl>
<dt>stable</dt>
<dd>This version is well tested and is the recommended version for
most users of Octave.</dd>
<!--
<dt>testing</dt>
<dd>A recent snapshot of the development sources that has been selected as
being reasonably good.  Most people who are not actively involved in
Octave's development will want to use this version.</dd>
-->
<dt>development</dt>
<dd>The most recent snapshot of the development sources (if one is
available).  Use this if you want the latest features and it doesn't
bother you that you might run into a few problems.  These snapshots
are <b>not</b> regular Octave releases.  They are only provided for
testing purposes, for people who would rather not bother with getting
sources from the Mercurial archive.  If you do find
problems in the development snapshots, please report them to the
maintainers@octave.org mailing list (but first read
__OCTAVE_HTTP__(`bugs.html', `the bug reporting guidelines')).
If you are interested in the absolutely-latest-up-to-the-minute
changes, you may use the sources from the public Mercurial archive
instead (see below for details).

__TITLE_BAR__(`Contributed Packages')

<p>A collection of contributed packages for Octave is available from
__HTTP__(`octave.sf.net').</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
__TITLE_BAR__(`Binaries')

<p>Please note that all binary distributions of Octave are built by
volunteers.  We make no promises about these binary packages.  If they
are out of date and you would like to help keep them current, please
contact the people who are responsible for the sites that distribute
the various packages.</p>

<h4>Linux</h4>

<p>Binaries for Linux distributions are generally available with
the distribution (__HTTP__(`www.debian.org', `Debian'),
__HTTP__(`www.novell.com/linux/suse', `SuSE'),
__HTTP__(`www.redhat.com', `RedHat'), and others have packages).</p>

<h4>Mac OS X</h4>

<ul>
<li>__HTTP__(`octave.sourceforge.net', `Octave Forge')</li>
<li>__HTTP__(`hpc.sourceforge.net',
             `Mac OS X High Performance Computing')</li>
<li>__HTTP__(`fink.sourceforge.net', `The Fink project')</li>
<li>__HTTP__(`www.macports.org', `MacPorts')</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sun Solaris</h4>

<p>The site __HTTP__(`www.sunfreeware.com') has a binary distribution
of Octave for Sun systems.</p>

<h4>Windows</h4>

<ul>
<li>The __HTTP__(`octave.sourceforge.net', `Octave Forge') project
hosts a native Windows binary distribution of Octave built with
MSVC.  It should also be possible to build a comparable package with
the MinGW compiler, but we need a volunteer for that job.</li>

<li>__HTTP__(`www.cygwin.com')
The __HTTP__(`cygwin.com', `Cygwin') project hosts binaries for
Cygwin users.  Look in the math category for the Octave package when
installing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>OS/2 or eComStation</h4>

<p>Dmitry Froloff has built OS/2 binaries that are available at
<a href="http://froloff.homeip.net/">http://froloff.homeip.net/</a>.</p>

__TITLE_BAR__(`Mirror Sites')

<p>If you have trouble transferring Octave from this site, you might try
one of those listed below.  They mirror the files from
__OCTAVE_FTP__(`', `ftp://ftp.octave.org/pub/octave').</p>

<p>__FTP__(`ftp.u-aizu.ac.jp/pub/SciEng/numanal/Octave')<br />
__HTTP__(`neacm.fe.up.pt/pub/octave/')<br />
__FTP__(`neacm.fe.up.pt/pub/octave')</p></p>

__TITLE_BAR__(`GNU Project FTP Site')

<p>The latest recommended release of the Octave sources may also be
found on the official Free Software Foundation ftp site,
__FTP__(`ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu', `ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu'),
which is also mirrored on many sites around the world.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
__TITLE_BAR__(`Development Sources')

<p>The latest development sources of Octave are also available via
anonymous access to a read-only
__HTTP__(`www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki', `Mercurial') archive.</p>

<p>The primary archive address is
__HTTP__(`www.octave.org/hg/octave'), which currently
redirects to __HTTP__(`hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave').</p>

<p>If the primary HG archive is unavailable, a secondary site is
__HTTP__(`velveeta.che.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/octave').</p>

<p>If you decide to use the development sources from the Mercurial
archive, please read the file __OCTAVE_FTP__(`/bleeding-edge/README',
`ftp://ftp.octave.org/pub/octave/bleeding-edge/README').</p>

<p>Bugfixes for the Octave 3.0 series are maintained in a seperate
repository, accessible at 
__HTTP__(`hg.tw-math.de/release-3-0-x',`http://hg.tw-math.de/release-3-0-x').</p>

<p>Assuming you have Mercurial installed on your machine you may check
out the latest development version of Octave sources with the following
command:</p>

<div class="code"><code>hg clone http://www.octave.org/hg/octave</code></div>

<p>Once you have the repository checked out, you can resync with the
archive by doing</p>

<div class="code">
<code>hg pull http://www.octave.org/hg/octave</code><br>
<code>hg update</code><br>
</div>

<p>See the Mercurial manual for additional information.</p>
