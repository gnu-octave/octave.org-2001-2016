  GNU Octave 4.0.3 was released July 2, 2016.  Please read the
  <a href="http://www.octave.org">announcement</a> on the front page of
  the Octave web site.

  <h1>GNU/Linux systems</h1>
  <p>
    Executable versions of Octave for GNU/Linux systems are provided
    by the individual distributions.  Distributions known to package
    Octave include: <a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a>,
    <a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a>,
    <a href="http://gentoo.org">Gentoo</a>,
    and <a href="http://opensuse.org">SuSE</a>.  These packages are
    created by volunteers.  The delay between an Octave source release
    and the availability of a package for a particular GNU/Linux
    distribution varies.  The Octave project has no control over that
    process.
  </p>

  <h1>BSD systems</h1>
  <p>
    Executable versions of Octave for BSD systems are provided
    by the individual distributions.
    Both <a href="http://freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>
    and <a href="http://openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> have Octave
    packages.  These packages are created by volunteers.  The delay
    between an Octave source release and the availability of a package
    for a particular GNU/Linux distribution varies.  The Octave
    project has no control over that process.
