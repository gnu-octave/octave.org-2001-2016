<h2>So, you tried to use a missing function...?</h2>

<p>
GNU Octave strives to be among the very best numerical tools
available.  While compatibility with Matlab is one of many strong
features of Octave, we have not achieved 100% compatibility.  If you
are reading this page, it is most likely because you attempted to use
a function that is part of core Matlab, but has yet to be implemented
in Octave.
</p>

<p>
There can be several reasons for the given function not to exist in
Octave:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The function may exist in <a href="http://octave.sourceforge.net">Octave-Forge</a>, but has not yet been adopted as a part of the core
    Octave distribution.  You can try to look for your function in the
    <a href="http://octave.sourceforge.net/functions_by_alpha.php">alphabetical list of functions</a> at the Octave-Forge web site to
    see if it is available in some package.
  </li>
  <li>
    The function may be new to Matlab.  It is possible that the Octave
    community simply does not know it exists. Should this be the case,
    feel free to open a feature request in the
    <a href="http://bugs.octave.org">Octave bug tracker</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The Octave community consists of volunteers working in their spare
time.  As a result, development might sometimes not be fast enough for
your needs.  If you have a feature request for Octave, the best way to
ensure that your suggested improvement gets incorporated is either to
implement the feature yourself or to pay somebody to do it for you.
