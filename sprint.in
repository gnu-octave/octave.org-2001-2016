    Texinfo, or any other esoteric skills. Expect to see Octave
    founder John W. Eaton online as well as others from the Octave
    maintainers list who rarely show up in other forums.

__TITLE_BAR__(`Goal')

<p>The purpose of a code sprint is to get people together to quickly
tackle a project that would be far too large, or take far too much
time, for individuals working alone.
Following <a href="http://octave.1599824.n4.nabble.com/Code-Sprint-Results-td3672698.html">the
success of our first sprint</a> the goal for Octave sprint #2 is</p>

<p><center><b>Reduce the number of untested functions by 1/2</b></center></p>

<p>The rationale for this goal is straightforward. The usual
programming cycle for new features is "code, test, fix everything
broken by the new feature". Currently, Octave does not have a complete
baseline set of tests. This means introducing new features, or quickly
patching a reported bug, often has unforeseen effects which break
other parts of Octave. Our long-term goal is to reach 100% test
coverage for all Octave functions so that the new feature development
loop can proceed much faster.
</p>
<p>
The finalized goal as of August 15, 2011 is to resolve testing issues
for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_structure_constant">137</a>
functions (274/2). A list of the files which need resolution can be
