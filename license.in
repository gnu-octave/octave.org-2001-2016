<p>The source code for Octave is freely redistributable under the terms
of the GNU General Public License
(__HTTP__(`www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html', `GPL')) as published by the
__HTTP__(`www.gnu.org', `Free Software Foundation').</p>

<p>Simply put, the GPL says that anyone who redistributes the software,
with or without changes, must pass along the freedom to further copy
and change it.  By distributing the complete source code for GNU
Octave under the terms of the GPL, we guarantee that you and all other
users will have the freedom to redistribute and change Octave.</p>

<p>Releasing the source code for Octave has another benefit as well.  By
having access to all of the source code for a mathematical system like
Octave, you have the ability to see <em>exactly</em> how each and
every computation is performed.  There are no black boxes that hide
the details of any calculation.</p>

<p>Although enhancements to Octave that are written as function files in
Octave's scripting language are not required to be redistributed under
the terms of the GPL, we encourage you to release your enhancements to
Octave under the same terms for the benefit of all users.  We also
encourage you to
__OCTAVE_HTTP__(`help-wanted.html', `submit your changes')
for inclusion in future versions of Octave.</p>
